Known Limitations

IMPORTANT ONES TO MAKE GAME PLAYABLE:
-Font has to be size 10 or smaller, y dimension should be above 46 lines to see the status bar.
-you have to press any button a couple of times after the first room gets drawn because if I were to draw it all at once, the monsters would all be the same.
 I base the random monsters on time, so the longer the wait between pushing a button, the more likely it will be random.
-Closing the program: If you quit game by dying or stairs, you have to hit q a couple of times to exit the program.

THE REST:
-Status bar and the top of the hallways appear normally after user moves once.
-The notifications bar sometimes has "." characters in it. No idea why or how to fix it.
-When the user walks into the "A" in the status bar, it gets treated as a monster, so please don't walk into it.
-Along the left vertical hallway, if the user walks to the left once more into the border,
 the hero moves to the right of the hallway and produces a walkable "." character.

-The troll cannot be attacked coming in from the left, it will just get overwritten. Not sure about other monsters.
-The bats randomly dissappear at a random turn count and at random locations.
-If the monsters are driven towards the walls, they have a chance of dissappearing.
-Monsters will always be the same in each room because the randomizer is based
 on time and the monsters in the room get generated at the exact same time.
